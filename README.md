Program for organizing many files in a group of folders where doing it with the mouse 
might be annoying and time consuming. It also would be good in environments where
users have access only to a terminal. a GUI version will come when this version is 
completed.

The program reads from a text file to take in information to know which paths 
to moves files to and which folders to move files from. It can also know which 
files to ignore and which file types.
